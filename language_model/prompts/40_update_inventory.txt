### Instruction:

From supplied JSON curren inventory of the character, generate an updated inventory based on the description and the action provided.
Take permissibility into account. For the response, use the following format:

```json-template
[
    "<item1>",
    "<item2>",
    "<item3>"
]
```

Current inventory:

```json
[
  "water"
]
```

Description: You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west and south.
There is a pile of leaves on the ground.

Permissibility:  The action 'I rake the leaves into a tidy pile' does not make sense for the character based on their inventory. The character has water, but no rake.

Action: You attempt to gather the leaves in your hands, but they keep slipping out and spreading around you. Eventually, you manage to form a somewhat tidy pile of leaves with what little control you have over them.

### Response: 

JSON updated inventory: 

```json
