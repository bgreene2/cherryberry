### Instruction:

From supplied JSON current health status of the character, generate an updated health
status based on the description and action provided. For the response, use the following format:

```json-template
{
  "hp": <new_hp_number>,
  "emotional": "<emotional_status>"
}
```

Current health status:

```json
{
  "hp": 100,
  "emotional": "You feel fine."
}
```

Description: You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west and south.
There is a pile of leaves on the ground.

Permissibility: The action 'I rake the leaves into a tidy pile' does not make sense for the character based on their inventory. The character has water, but no rake.

Action: You attempt to gather the leaves in your hands, but they keep slipping out and spreading around you. Eventually, you manage to form a somewhat tidy pile of leaves with what little control you have over them.

### Response: 

JSON updated health status: 

```json
{
  "hp":
