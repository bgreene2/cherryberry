### Instruction:

From supplied description, generate a new updated description based on description and action provided.

Description: You are in a clearing, with a forest surrounding you on the west and south.
There is a pile of leaves on the ground.

Permissibility:  The action 'I rake the leaves into a tidy pile' does not make sense for the character based on their inventory. The character has water, but no rake.

Action: You attempt to gather the leaves in your hands, but they keep slipping out and spreading around you. Eventually, you manage to form a somewhat tidy pile of leaves with what little control you have over them.
